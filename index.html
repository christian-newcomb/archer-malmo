                            I enjoyed this Field Trip. I will now tell you step by step what I did on the marvelous day that is known as The Trip De Malmo, Archer. At approximately 8:40, I lined up in the main office to get on my vehicle of transportation. On this bus I completely ignored my best bud Kyle, so I could read the (2011) Green Lantern issues.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            As we arrived to Archer-Malmo, we realized that we had a flat tire. Before this flat tire turned into our demise, we made an emergency exit. At this point we were already in a close vicinity of the building so we took to foot. It was cold. I mean really cold. I had doubts that all of us were even going to make it. Once we finally got there we had to wait outside for what seemed to be a year for our teacher to catch up. The worst part was that you could feel the warmth coming from the front doors.

                      <h2>

                      </h2>
                      <p>
                        When we walked in it felt as though we had went back in time, but went to the future as well. We waited. Some talked. Some wept due to the cold. I just stood in awe as I looked around at the glorious design of this room. After a minute or two Ms. Sinclair's friend arrived to take us up. We took the elevators. It was not fun. When we got to the floor we were going the cutest dogs ran by. Rocket was the name of one and I did not catch the other one. We were then instructed to sit.

                      <p> After we took our places among each other on the floor, some of the best bearded men I have ever seen arrived. They all looked like Jack. We sat there for about an hour and a half. I listened intently to every detail I could. Occasionally I got distracted by a dog collar or two. I almost started laughing as a read on a board that someone wanted to turn an area into a vap lounge. After the amazing speeches we began touring.

                      <p> 
                        After the tour, we all had to leave this heaven on Earth. On the bus ride home we all sat extremely sad. We masked our pain behind the facade of extreme joy and happiness. For the rest of the day I felt as if there was a hole in my heart, and that I could never live up to the joy that was experienced at Archer Malmo. Thank you guys for having us!
